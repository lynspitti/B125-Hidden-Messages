        \caption{The cup has a great usability in that its easy to learn how to use it properly. The tap on the cup stands out from the otherwise cylinder shaped cup, which makes it very recognisable. The tap the cup has multiple purposes usability-wise, for instance it makes it safer to use when the cup contains hot liquid. The tap also makes for added efficiency and overall convenience.
        Moreover, the tap is shaped in such a way that it accommodates several fingers allowing for a solid grip with a range of hand sizes. The smooth finish of the handle is used for a pleasant user experience. The sense of control over the cup also adds to this pleasantness of the experience}

\section{Questionnaire}

In this section we are expecting that our product is a app, used to send and receive hidden messages through Instagram. This is done by letting the user select a forum "subject", and then post answers or new questions through a written message. The app then hides the message in a picture, and posts it on Instagram for everybody to see. The app then also contains functionality to receive and decrypt these messages again, to display for other users.\\
The Goal with this questionnaire is to identify the applications user group. This is so that the group has an easier time creating a good design platform, wanted by the users.\\\\
\noindent
The group has discussed creating a questionnaire like the following.
The idea is that the questionnaire contains normal questions to define a specific user group.
But also questions that in a certain combination can be identified as typical users for our product.\\\\
