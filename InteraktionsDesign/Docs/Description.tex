\section{Short project description}
The goal of the project is to provide people with a tool to maintain some degree of freedom of speech, as well as independent thought, in dictatorial regimes. 
The goal has been chosen due to the potential future risks of ever increasing levels of monitoring across the globe. The intended users are therefore any citizen wanting to discuss the current state of affairs as well as activists that actively try to spread awareness in suppressed populations. The project could also be used by journalists working in the same regions. The military, or indeed intelligence services, might also be able to draw use from the same project. Although the potential benefits are numerous it is important to mention that secure communication could just as well be use by criminals to work against the needs of society.
