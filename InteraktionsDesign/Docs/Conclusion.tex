\section{Conclusion}
From the experiment it has been made evident, that a number of improvements can be made to the prototype. The most important of these is the ability to better explain the security concept, as well as alleviating the confusion caused by small UI elements, which most of the test users experienced.
\noindent
Specifically concerning the null hypothesis posed for the experiment three differing stances seemed to occur. Firstly, some test users said they would be willing to switch to a different product if the other product had the same features, with some features being more important than others though. Secondly, some test users said they would only really consider switching if they had felt severely compromised on their current platform. Thirdly, some users said that a really important thing would be that ones contacts would also switch. Of course some participants could appreciate more than one of these stances.
\noindent
While it was not possible to determine the statistical significance, due to a much too small sample size, it was made clear that a security increase alone might not convince quite as many people to switch to a different platform as one might have otherwise assumed.
