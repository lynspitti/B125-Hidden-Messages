\section{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    %\item The system should be able to send messages through some social media.
    %\item Messages, sent by the system, should not clearly seem to be a message, in the first place.
    %\item The product should not require any personal information itself.
    \item[1] \textbf{The product should not take longer than 1 minute to install.} \hfill \\ 
    This requirement regards The user [persona 3] as these would only use the product if it would not require a greater effort.
    \item[2] \textbf{9 out of 10 users should, without excessive amounts of error, be able to navigate the product.} \hfill \\ 
    This requirement ensures that as many users as possible can use the product without added frustration. The goal is to make the user have as easy a time with this product as any other social platform.
    \item[3] \textbf{8 out of 10 users should clearly know (after installation) how the product preserves their privacy.} \hfill \\
    This requirement helps to attract both The concerned and the non concerned [Persona 1 \& 2] as these are both interested in the enhancement of their security but especially the concerned would only use the product if he could see and understand the actual benefit.
    %\item The system should be able to receive and display messages sent by other users.
    \item[4] \textbf{8 out of 10 users have to feel that their messages have been securely delivered.} \hfill \\
    This requirement is important as the product needs to provide the different users, especially the concerned [Persona 2], with this feeling, as the user otherwise, with particular focus on the normal user [Persona 3], wouldn't use the product more than once.
    \item[5] \textbf{At least 9 out of 10 users should understand the product's basic concept in less than 1 minute.} \hfill \\
    This requirement is set to make new users less likely to give up on understanding the product. A lack of understanding could in turn lead to either misuse of the product or no use of the product at all.
    %\item Users have to be able to chain messages together.
\end{itemize}

        Figure \ref{fig:usecase} on the left describes a conceptual model of what the basic functionality of the inconspicuous communication platform looks like. The model describes how a sender, receiver and a external social media will interface with the system. The "Send message" action will be interfaced with by the sender and will deliver the message to the system for further processing. The "Login" action connects the sender, receiver and social media together. The "View message" action will be interfaced with by the receiver and displays a message from the system. The "Delete message" will be interfaced with by both the sender and the social media and will trigger a message deletion request to the system.
